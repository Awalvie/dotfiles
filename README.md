# boomer dotfiles

Minimal boomer dotfiles. The dotfile organization has been heavily ~~copied~~ inspired from [Icyphox's Dotfiles](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles/tree/master/bash/.bashrc.d)

### To Do:

- [ ] Break down `.zshrc` into separate files,
	- exports
	- aliases
	- prompt

- [ ] Break down `nvim/init.vim` into separate files, refer: [icyphox's nvim config](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles/tree/master/config/nvim)
- [ ] Setup `z` for jumping around directories. Refer: [rupa/z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
- [ ] Write your own 16 bit color theme
