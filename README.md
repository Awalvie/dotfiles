# boomer dotfiles

Minimal boomer dotfiles. The dotfile organization has been heavily ~~copied~~ inspired from [Icyphox's Dotfiles](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles/tree/master/bash/.bashrc.d)

### To Do:

- [ ] Break down .zshrc into separate files,
	- exports
	- aliases
	- prompt

- [ ] Setup `z` for jumping around directories. Refer: [rupa/z](https://github.com/rupa/z)
